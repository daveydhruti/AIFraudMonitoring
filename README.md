# AI Fraud Monitoring Terminal 

**RedLine AI** is a high-fidelity, cyber-industrial financial surveillance terminal. It bridges the gap between complex data analytics and high-urgency risk management, providing analysts with a "System-Critical" interface for real-time threat detection.

## 🛠️ The Mission
Traditional fraud dashboards are often sterile and slow. **RedLine AI** is built for the "Command Deck" experience—prioritizing urgency, precision, and rapid response through:
* **Live Intercept:** Real-time transaction stream simulation.
* **Heuristic Scoring:** Multi-factor risk analysis (Geo-spatial + Merchant reputation).
* **Tactical UX:** A custom "System-Boot" glitch interface designed to reduce cognitive load during high-threat windows.
